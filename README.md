# hello-world
My first attempt at learning how to use Github!

## Making Edits
And this is apparently my first attempt at working on a branch.

## Continued Editing
I suppose the built in editor at GitHub is sufficient for a lot of things, but I really hope I crack the code (ha!) of doing this sort of thing in VS Code and then pushing it back to here.

# Big News!
Before I forget - applied for Awesome Inc. Bootcamp today, 5/5/22. :-)

## Python
Picked up a 'teach yourself' Python book and surprised at how easily it's coming back.
