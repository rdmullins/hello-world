# hello-world
My first attempt at learning how to use Github!

## Making Edits
And this is apparently my first attempt at working on a branch.

## Continued Editing
I suppose the built in editor at GitHub is sufficient for a lot of things, but I really hope I crack the code (ha!) of doing this sort of thing in VS Code and then pushing it back to here.

# Big News!
Before I forget - applied for Awesome Inc. Bootcamp today, 5/5/22. :-)

## Python
Picked up a 'teach yourself' Python book and surprised at how easily it's coming back.

# Update
Got accepted to bootcamp! Sent my acceptance email today.

# Boot Camp Demo Day Spring 2022
Went to watch Demo Day today. Eight very solid presentations, mostly using some combination of React and Django for the back-end. 

# Evernote
I re-installed Evernote and put the web clipper in my Brave setup. Really going to make an effort to use it throughout the bootcamp.

# Harvard Python Course
Gary sent a link to an open Harvard CS course that uses Python - going to work through it. I also signed up for a blog to chronicle the bootcamp process.

# Linux Book
Started reading an Ubuntu manual today. Just to remember some things.

# Slack to Evernote
Spent some time today moving resources from the Intro to Web class slack channel into Evernote. May repeat for other channels while I have access to them.

# Working on 100 Days of CSS
The assignment today is kicking my butt (my whole container is animating, and not just the part of it that's supposed to) but, in general, it's a learning experience which is sort of the point. I'll keep at it.
