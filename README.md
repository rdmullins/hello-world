# hello-world
My first attempt at learning how to use Github!

## Making Edits
And this is apparently my first attempt at working on a branch.

## Continued Editing
I suppose the built in editor at GitHub is sufficient for a lot of things, but I really hope I crack the code (ha!) of doing this sort of thing in VS Code and then pushing it back to here.

# Big News!
Before I forget - applied for Awesome Inc. Bootcamp today, 5/5/22. :-)

## Python
Picked up a 'teach yourself' Python book and surprised at how easily it's coming back.

# Update
Got accepted to bootcamp! Sent my acceptance email today.

# Boot Camp Demo Day Spring 2022
Went to watch Demo Day today. Eight very solid presentations, mostly using some combination of React and Django for the back-end. 

# Evernote
I re-installed Evernote and put the web clipper in my Brave setup. Really going to make an effort to use it throughout the bootcamp.
