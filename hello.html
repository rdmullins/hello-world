  <h1>Coding on a Cell Phone</h1>

  <p>
  I am writing this HTML on my phone. I'm away from my computer and wanted to see if it was possible to do at least an emergency edit this way. So far I have discovered the following. 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Github Android app does not allow creating or editing.</li>
    <li>The mobile website does.</li>
    <li>It is <strong>really</strong> hard to do this on a phone.</li>
    <li>This might be easier on my tablet where I at least have a keyboard.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  And that is the result of this experiment. I could handle this in a pinch or for a really small job but it's not something I would want to do on a regular basis.
