    <h1>Roger's Glitch Projects</h1>
    <p>
        This is a very basic page to keep track of my Glitch projects while I work on moving the important ones into Github. (This is also my first attempt at creating a code file in Visual Studio Code and then adding it to my repository).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stormy-sunset-hurricane.glitch.me"><em>Boom Towns</em></a>
            <ul>
                <li>My HTML/CSS capstone project, a companion site for a book project.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://flax-bedecked-pentagon.glitch.me"><em>Boom Towns</em></a> (Bootstrap version)
            <ul>
                <li>The same project page as above, but completely refactored using the <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> framework. My first serious attempt at using Bootstrap.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sustaining-fog-legume">Nutrition API Call</a>
            <ul>
                <li>My first attempt at a project making an API call. This takes a product barcode and searches for it, then returns nutrition information. The prompt is a popup box when the JS executes, and the results are returned in the console. This could be refined into an actual site but since the data is all European I put it on hold for the time being.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://stream-airy-visage.glitch.me">Shakespeare's History and Comedy Plays</a>
            <ul>
                <li>An array exercise. A mixed array of objects representing Shakespeare's history and comedy plays is sorted into the two categories, first by an <pre>if</pre> and then again by <pre>map</pre>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://flaxen-grape-asphalt.glitch.me">Funnny Story Generator</a>
            <ul>
                <li>An exercise in DOM manipulation from the MDN site.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://maroon-gregarious-lady.glitch.me">JavaScript Photo Gallery</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Another exercise from the MDN site. Practice with swapping out DOM elements, resizing images, transparency labels, button usage, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://proximal-amusing-verdict.glitch.me">Color Boxes Generated Dynamically</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Nothing terribly fancy, but an in-class exercise at using JS to generate DOM elements dynamically.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
       
    </ul>
