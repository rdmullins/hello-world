    <h1>Roger's Glitch Projects</h1>
    <p>
        This is a very basic page to keep track of my Glitch projects while I work on moving the important ones into Github. (This is also my first attempt at creating a code file in Visual Studio Code and then adding it to my repository).

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stormy-sunset-hurricane.glitch.me"><em>Boom Towns</em></a>
            <ul>
                <li>My HTML/CSS capstone project, a companion site for a book project.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://flax-bedecked-pentagon.glitch.me"><em>Boom Towns</em></a> (Bootstrap version)
            <ul>
                <li>The same project page as above, but completely refactored using the <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> framework. My first serious attempt at using Bootstrap.</li>
            </ul>
